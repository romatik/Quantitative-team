So, the student is kept busy and unable to integrate or try solve problems that might crop up in their daily lives.

The result is that they, themselves, aren't much invested in assisting international students (particularly in Rome!). They are not well-informed either; they don't have the time for it. AstroMundus seems to be run by a group of people who all want the programme to work, but none of them are willing to invest the time, human and material resources in order for the programme to run smoothly!

The professors see to the needs of their students and are willing to tailor the program to the background of each, so everyone can spend their time learning something new.

Nobody in Graduate School knew much about us Erasmus Mundus students so to provide us information about the modules, courses etc., the students organization has appearently NO interest in involving non-French students in the activities and foreign students are often living in different buildings, so that interaction with Polytechnicians is null. It feels like being a pariah in a world of cool people wearing fancy uniforms and carrying swords.  The situation is radically different in Warwick, I don't think much else needs to be done: the Freshers' Week and the Student Societies Fair is enough to start networking with the local students, and on an academic level the Complexity department is a big and perfecly organized family, enrolling to courses in other departments is easy and the access to information is immediate.",Strongly agree,Agree,Strongly agree,"Some do, other do not",Somewhat (weak or unclear systems),Yes,Yes,No,,,,I am not sure,"Contacting the administration in Warwick is easy and a prompt response is guaranteed in most of the cases.

Half of it should be paid by the people where we do the M1 or M2 project, but we'd need a pass well before that time...It would be nice if EU and non-EU students were taxed of the same proportion in order to fund a bus pass for everyone staying at Polytechnique.

They are virtually in-existent and in the case of my Erasmus experience, I've crossed them only a couple of times for pointless meetings.  There are several important issues they should address, especially since they are alumni and they've gone through these situations already: 1. housing (decent accommodation for someone traveling to a completely foreign countries) 2. setting up channels for informing people about living expenses 3. setting up channels for informing people about administrative procedures needed for immigration purposes, social purposes (sometimes social help is available, but students cannot know about it, whereas alumni do), uni administration purposes  ALL these are important!","1. Housing. It is ridiculous to expect a student moving half-way around the continent or the world to know everything about housing availability, real estate market and so on. Moreover, a student cannot decide for a place (especially rent an apartment w/o seeing it first). Get something done about accommodation, because it's making us lose a lot of time and a lot of the (little) money some of us have. Additionally it transforms the whole moving into a foreign country experience in a living hell. Just be more informative to people!  2. Finances! Do something about the scholarships for the EU students! They are ridiculous and cannot motivate them, especially when you compare them to the non-EU students. When you go in a store to buy a bread, nobody asks you whether you're from Antigua just to charge you twice for the bread - so why do they receive 2 times more the scholarship, EU students receive. Not only it's not fair, but the thing which is the most disturbing is that the amount an EU student receives barely helps him get by! I challenge anyone from EACEA to try and pay rent + utilities + food + transportation with a bit more than 400 EUR / month.  3. Find a way to evaluate teachers! Some of them shouldn't be teaching in international programs. Evaluate their English speaking skills (if us, as students are required to get a certificate of English as a foreign language, teachers should do to, because some of them don't manage to make themselves understood). Then, evaluate the grades their students get; sometimes problems can be tracked from this kind of investigation. Then, ask for feedback from the students and actually take it into account.","1. For most of the problems regarding moving in a foreign countries, each master course HAS TO be required to have a web page referencing this kind of information in whichever form they wish (a wiki would be perfect and easy to build with the help of graduate students).  2.

Unless you talk with a current or former student, there's no way to find out any specifics of the courses or their prerequisites (no syllabi on the website, etc.). 2)  Related to the first point, the program accepts many (in fact, mostly) students without the appropriate backgrounds for the courses. I do well because I just finished university and have a strong enough background in math and computer science. Some of the students, however, have come into the program not knowing how to code (and some of the classes require extensive programming) and not having had some basic math background (with some classes containing reasonably difficult mathematical concepts). Some students have the background, but haven't seen it in 10 years. This inhibits the ability of the professors to provide the best content and also means that the students without the proper background have to work incredibly hard to catch up, and they wind up depressed and discouraged. This is all do to the fact that prerequisites are not communicated in advance and that the program accepts unqualified candidates. 3)  In the first semester of the program, all students take the same courses in order to provide ""the same background material required for the rest of the course."" However, it seems there's some requirement to include a professor from each university, because, despite extensive complaints, they continue to offer a software methodologies class from the university in Bucharest that teaches almost exclusively outdated concepts, and with a professor who does nothing but read text off of slides for 3 hours at a time.  Each year complains, but they do nothing to change. The logic class is okay, but is not at all required for all specialties (which students branch off into after the first semester). In order to improve, the program should either eliminate the common courses the first semester and jump straight into specialties, or do a better job of determining what is truly relevant for the whole masters.",,Adequate,Adequate,No answer,No answer,Very inadequate,Very inadequate,Excellent,,,,Adequate,Good,Inadequate

Fortunately, a provisional certificate was all that was needed for my current job, but this is unacceptable in any case.  2) Unify the thesis assignment procedure: give students the flexibility to pick thesis advisors from any university in the consortium, and allow those of us who are interested to do thesis projects from external labs and the industry. Currently, the way a student is hard-assigned to a university for the thesis semester makes this impossible.  3) The coursework at IST and KTH was excellent and top-notch, and the skills I picked up have given me an edge in my current job.

They were mainly concerned with the attendance of students, but there was no social gathering or academic talks organised. The University should focus more on providing an academic discussion rather than treating postgraduate students like first year freshers.   The EUR and AMU organised a welcome gathering and introduced us to all other students and PhD candidates. There was a very warm welcome by those two Universities!",Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,"Yes, all universities do",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Somewhat,Somewhat,Very strong,There are three ways:  1. Student Representative: At each term there is an election of a student representative. One could notify the representative who would then bring up the matter at the midterm meeting.  2. Ombudsman: One could contact the Ombudsman.  3. University of Hamburg: Administrative issues like allocations are handled by the University of Hamburg. One can always contact the coordinators at Hamburg directly.,Yes,"Yes! At the first term students complained about the teaching of Public Law and Economics. After we complained at the evaluation forms, the teacher was replaced.","After I have completed this postgraduate course and also an undergraduate course with a University consortium, I have several improvements in mind. However, I do not have the time to participate in all meetings. Thus, it might be a good idea to introduce a way for Alumni students to send in ideas and recommendations in writing.",Excellent,Good,Adequate,Good,Inadequate,Good,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,Yes,Yes,It is necessary to find a way to evaluate the dedication of the different universities. I had the feeling that some universities are more dedicated to the programme than others.,"Dedication of Universities: Some universities are more dedicated than others. The experience of the programme depends mainly on the dedication of the Universities. Universities like the EUR, Hamburg, Ghent are very dedicated and organise academic talks and debates, whereas the Universita di Bologna was only concerned with attendance, but did not organise any talks.  Truly Interdisciplinary Programme: In the programme there are either economics faculties or Law Schools involved. This resulted in a few errors in law during the analysis. Whereas the professors at EUR are jurists with additional degrees in economics, at other universities there are only economists. I find it necessary to divide the teaching between the faculty of economics and law at each university.   Comparative Law: The analysis of law was mainly focused on American Law, because most academics publishing in L&E are American scholars. However, the American approaches are very problematic in Europe, as they infringe the constitutional provisions in EU Member States / EU Charta on human Rights. I would advice an analysis focusing on the Law of EU Member States in an comparative analysis with the American approach/law.","Unfortunately, the Course European Union Law and Economics is only offered at the University of Hamburg (Third Term). I find it necessary to teach the course at all Universities, as the EMLE programme is intended to provide for European Integration.  Also I would suggest to provide more specialisation. Instead of offering Public Law and Economics, Comparative Law and Economics, etc. I suggest to offer two/three main (large) modules Comparative Law and Economics I and II in term I and II. The two modules should cover the main ideas in Constitutional/Public, Criminal and Contract Law. Further modules like Competition Law and Economics, Intellectual Property Law and Economics, Labour Law and Economics, etc should be offered as optional modules taught in smaller, intense seminars. It should be possible to visit all seminars, but it is only necessary to sit the Comparative L&E, an economics module and two optional modules each term.  Furthermore, I would suggest to include more economic modules. So far it is compulsory to sit Microeconomics in the first term. I would also include Macroeconomics and Industrial Economics (or similar modules) in the second and third term.  The EMLE provides a great environment for specialisation and the study of different theories and ideas. I think this course provides the best possible potential for a truly interdisciplinary programme with specialisation in different areas of L&E.",Good,Adequate,Inadequate,No answer,Good,Excellent,Good,No answer,Excellent,Adequate,Good,Good,Good

The assessment of my thesis did not meet the rules/requirements circulated by faculty yet there was no way to have it reviewed. My thesis (and many others) was scored with a divergence of over 40% suggesting that some supervisors do not understand what they are preparing students for. My external reviewer made factually incorrect statements but there was no process to address these. None of these concerns were responded to in a timely manner (i.e. it took months and several emails to get a response) and the response failed to engage with any of the issues raised. 2. How are students expected to learn if they are not provided with their marked exams in order to see what they did right/wrong. The failure to return exams also poses serious transparency issues for the assessment. 3. In Bologna the only form of assessment was examination.

For example, making sure students have internet at student dorms right away, will let them solve their own problems.

In my opinion, syllabus can not be used as a standard of a course content, all of the consortium board needs to know clearly what will the students get from each of the university, and new syllabus can be made if needed. I think it will be also better if the erasmus students are not mixed with the new student esp with the student who just starts their study and with erasmus students who are in the 2nd semeester or so, because there's a gap of knowledge among them and will make the learning process difficult (too slow for erasmus students and too fast for non-erasmus student)",Good,Good,Excellent,Inadequate,Good,Good,Good,,,,Good,Good,Good

And after a couple of days they found a very good accomodation for me. It was not easy but they made a great job, because at that time I didn't speak french. In the personal and professional ULG made an execellent job, my best experience as Erasmus mundus student.  Then in the ECN we already have an accomodation from day 1 until the last day. It was a very nice accomodation, and they introduce all the students associations and the international office. I have to say that the ULG french course was more professional than ECN, maybe because at the ULG they have an internet platform to improve at home.  Finally at the UNIGE nobody really care about us. The housing support was useless and there was no compromise at all. I spend two months in the summer to find an accomodation. Nobody provides any information for the language courses. The visa/residence permit was really difficult to complete and there was a lack of information in all the process. They never present an estimation of living expenses. The local transportation was very bad there was a lot of strykes and delates. I lost two important meetings because of the strykes. There was no fieldwork. Very disorganized.

So at the end when I finally got the information to develop my thesis it was too late, I had like two months to finish the thesis.  Finally, the contact with international companies; I see a lot of European companies but too little companies that looks for people worldwide.

In numerous cases my time and budget have suffered due to misinformation or no information. For example, visa issuing in Slovenia - I have advised I will be in and out of the country on monthly basis and have received a confirmation that in that case visa is not necessary. However, upon the arrival, I was told i needed a visa and had to stay at the opposite side of the town for months, which caused longer travels, gas expenses, not being able to participate in group projects and higher rent. My visa procedure had some delays at the embassy and it took the university three months to finally listen to my request and get involved. Eventually, I got the visa for the final two weeks of the entire 4-month semester.  Another example is misguidance by the coordinator Justyna K. which made the entire class believe she will asssist in arranging summer internships. the arrangements and a conference call with her took place during two final weeks of the semester after which she simply stopped anwering to anyone who applied. Everyone was supposed to propose three companies and she could not accommodate any of them. This was again a very unprofessional move because after I have contacted the companies myself they have offered to work for them. Due to late arrangements and all delays, my summer work took longer and i could return only a week later then the official begining of the classes. The courses and projects started already and my final grade suffered due to this. These are only two example of completely wrong guidence, misinformation and negligence caused by coordinators Yustina from Girona and Jozica in Slovenia.

Apart from that, the main coordinator but also all the member of the consortium were available both by email and even live, if geographically that was possible. It was very easy to get access to their offices, talk to them and bring up any issue that might have arisen. Also, the secretariat was extremely helpful, replying to all requests within a maximum of 48 hours.

After visiting myself the classroom of the next generation, I saw that they had already implemented changes, changed the professor and the curriculum for this class.","Honestly, I think the channels are enough. The only recommendation for change that I would make would be that the consortium imforms us of how they are planning to change things, depending on our feedback, so that the change is more noticeable and tangible, because sometimes it happens within a year's time and it gets implemented only from the next generation on, without us noticing, so letting us know in advance what they are working on might be a good idea, so that we feel even more connected.",Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Yes,Yes,"I think the main issue that most Erasmus Mundus programs are facing currently is the issue of promotion, so that the programs can be sustainable in the long run, even if the number of scholarships provided are cut for financial reasons. Also, it would be nice to bring up the issue of internships, as part of the course (it currently is not necessary to do an internship to graduate). The representatives should try to raise awareness of these two issues, creating interest of other students to look for partners, sponsors and so on to cover both needs.","The only aspect that I would improve would be to be a little more aware of the evaluation system in some classes. Since some of the classes were taught by more than one professor, sometimes it was not clear until the last moment how the grading would be decided.   I honestly cannot think of 2 more aspects, simply because in general I was very satisfied with the overall experience and I would repeat it, if I could.","EMTM was a life-changing experience for me, which taught me not only about tourism, but life itself. I felt surrounded by an amazing team of people, whose spirit to create was shining bright and I saw places and events of the world that other people would not even dream of.

It would be difficult to summarize my opinion in one or two words. I believe the university has so much potential owing to its location and comprehensive program me, but there are several areas that would need improving.  1- Communication between staff and students: The person in charge has been replaced, which is good news, as he was doing an awful job, and most of the information was relayed by the students themselves. We also had several problems with one of our professors and head of the MA whose classes were extremely confusing, sloppy, and he often made last-minute changes in his program or proceedings which caused a lot of incertitude and instability. Structural changes have been made as of this term, so perhaps this will not be the case anymore. 2- General atmosphere: I think it is important to point this out. It seems abnormal that the 10 students of the first semester left Strasbourg frustrated and disappointed - nay robbed - of their money and time. While we all agree some classes were of outstanding quality (as well as their fantastic teachers), the deep-rooted structural problems, sheer lack of communication, and dismissive attitudes from some teachers dealt a severe blow to our trust in the degree. There was admittedly a strong dichotomy between the presentation of the degree (""Master of Excellence"", etc) and the actual experience we had in Strasbourg. I would suggest above all a change in leadership and the destitution of the current person in charge who - we believe - in no way possessed the vital human or technical skills for his function. Again, in spite of my criticism, I would like to once more highlight the other side of story where we partook in fabulous experiences within the European Institutions, and other such outings (Paris, Metz). I still, however, believe that this is not enough, and a strong, pragmatic approach to the structural problems must be addressed before adding the final touches. Moving on, I would like to praise some of the academic staff for the outstanding quality of their classes, they definitely tipped the scale.  And finally, considering the changes that have been made (leadership, organization, cooperation with research labs such as the SAGE, etc.). I assume a great many of these issues will be solved. Strasbourg offers so many opportunities, it is without doubt an ideal location for any Euroculture student. Thank you for this opportunity.",Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Neutral,"Yes, all universities do",I am not sure,Yes,I am not sure,Yes,I am not sure,,,Strong,In general complaints or questions are addressed to any university coordinator and/or brought up to the higher levels.,Yes,"Especially regarding the University of Strasbourg, I know for a fact that substantial changes have been made (officially, we shall have to see how they are applied - it is France after all).",,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,,,Agree,Agree,,Agree,Yes,Yes,,In Strasbourg: Communication (vertical and horizontal).,,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,,,,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent

In this regard I think it would be difficult to compare the two, even though significant efforts appear to have been made on Strasbourg's side to enhance the quality of the degree. As regards Groningen, a better housing scheme could perhaps have helped us spend less time searching for accommodation, but again, housing shortage is a well-known fact in Groningen, and through a philosophical approach I would say that I made the most of both cities/universities, each one having brought me so much. Groningen for its exceptional academic quality and resources, and Strasbourg for the proximity of European institutions, the wonderful and hands-on excursions we engaged in, and the professors, some of which were simply fantastic and with whom I learned a great deal.",Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,"Yes, all universities do",Yes,Yes,I am not sure,Yes,I am not sure,,,Very strong,"There are several ways, through the official online platform (at the end of each semester), and through the official meeting which takes place during the Intenseive Programme, and where representatives from each university/semester convene along with professors to discuss and comment on our experience, with a view of improving the degree in each partner university.

I know for a fact that improvements have been made along those lines, so I would not say this is still the case, and it is my pride and pleasure to have studied in such a fabulous University and in such a wonderful city that offered so many opportunities!  Groningen: The overall quality of the course at the RuG was outstanding, perhaps slightly too much of a workload, but the challenge of it was so thrilling that it's hard to say whether or not the current configuration of courses should be changed...

Because supervisorss from Europe did not avoid it, did not ask us how was it going and were only concerned about the good relation with their contact abroad and the possible publications... it was slavery.

It was quite a hell to stay there.

Which is understandable. But still, it was very difficult to find a place from our home country. 2. information about the term dates - apparently after finishing the two terms there is a non-credit academic writing course, which is great. The only problem is that we weren't aware about it before coming to London and we arranged our housing contracts only for the term periods (excluding the non-credit course period, which will be provided in the third term). I think the consortium should prepare a welcome packet for students with all the information included (and post it on the program web-site as well). 3. I think internship should be mandatory for everybody and the consortium must be providing it. The consortium having a contract with different organizations providing internship is not enough as they have only six available positions and there are 19 students in my batch.","In general, the program is fantastic!

Also I performed better/equal than/with the students who possess the grant for both the years.

Orientation in University 2 (ROSE School) was given one month and a half after I arrived, i.e. already after the first course had ended and I had already had my first exam. Orientation should take place within the first week. By the time I had it, I had already struggled to collect that information from classmates who had started here from the first semester. Examples of contrast between the two universities (U1 and U2): Bank: U1 sent us to the bank with personnel from the Int. Relations office in order to do all the procedures. U2 just told me ""go to any bank"" (and I went by myself). Health: U1 told us what to do in case of needing medical assistance. When I specifically asked how the health insurance worked on email, U2 simple said ""go to the hospital"", whithout even  saying which hospital, if there was more than one hospital in town, etc.",Agree,Agree,Neutral,"Some do, other do not",I am not sure,No,No,Somewhat,Somewhat,,,Adequate,"I believe he/she should email the Secretariat of the Consortium, or address the Academic Coordinator of the place he/she is currently at.",,,"University 2 requests students to fill in evaluation forms at the end of each course but, for example, one of the questions is related to the adequacy of the grading... and they ask you to fill in the form as a requirement to be informed that course's grade... how would one now if the grading is adequate if you haven't seen how the grading is carried out yet?",Excellent,Excellent,Adequate,Good,,,Agree,Agree,Neutral,,Yes,No,,"(1) When I was still at home, before coming to Europe, it was very difficult to understand if I needed to ask for one or two Visas before coming, or if I should just take the one for the first country and then take a second one for the other country while already being at the first one... (Please note that I acquired the Italian citizenship after finishing my Master, so I needed Visas for both countries). I asked, and the answers were not clear (not even in the Italian Consulate, until I finally managed to talk to the Italian person issuing visas in my country, who told me he could not issue a visa for me 6 months in advance, and that I should contact the Italian Consulate in France when I got there. But the whole process of trying to figure this out was painful. (2) The schedule regarding first orientation meetings and beginning of academic activities was sent to me less than one month before leaving Argentina... I had asked when exactly I was suppossed to arrive to France, and got as an answer (from the main Secretariat, not from UJF) to look at the courses' schedule. But the schedule just said generic dates. For people needing to buy expensive plane tickets, it'd be useful to know in advance the exact date at which their presence is required (I just assumed a date and bought it). (3) In University 2, it would have been useful to have a meeting in which professors/researchers offered thesis topics to students. I know they started doing it in the years after me.","Even though it might seem that I'm taking it too hard regarding some organizational issues, I really enjoyed the programme and I'll always be thankful for this amazing opportunity that certainly changed my life for the best. My comments regarding logistics aim at helping future students who will probably face the same doubts I faced and for which it was difficult to find answers. Once I arrived to Europe, I began to understand how things worked and everything got easier, but there are many topics regarding which the Universities could provide valuable information in the months before starting the programme (specially regarding immigration issues for those travelling from far away). It would also be useful to make the process of communicating the admission results something common to all Erasmus Mundus programmes. I had actually applied to two programmes (the other one was the SAHC), and they had different times to communicate partial and final admission results, so it was quite hard when having to choose between the two, because SAHC was always clearer in the way they communicated with me, while MEEES was just telling me that I was ""eligible"" for a scholarship, while what they really meant was that I had already been awarded it, in case I confirmed I was taking that one and no other Erasmus Mundus one.

What SHOULD be improved is the presentation of the master, which listed a huge number of courses... which in fact we could not attend. I choose this master because there were courses in Ecology listed. I could not take any, because we could not choose our courses. Saying which courses are actually available would be a huge improvment.  Everything was not perfect everywhere (Montpellier is much less used to welcoming international students than Uppsala, clearly), but in general, I would say we were treated very well, faculty and administrators were very helpful and gave us numerous advices. The summer school at the begining of each year, with all coordinators (and later, former students) was a great help as one can ask every questions.  Possible improvment : maintaning forums for a given university with all information available.

As it was the first year the consortium existed, it was very important. The description of the courses was an exception, though, and a bad one. But otherwise, I would say that I felt that they really were listening to our feedbacks, asking for them regularly, and trying to improve. Even if there was no formal way, I was feeling quite free to discuss the problematic matters with any of our coordinators, and I did it when needed. During the summer schools, a whole session was dedicated to feedbacks.","Montpellier should be advised to have an official feedback system. So far, everything was being done through student representative, direct discussions with coordinators or course examinators, or enquiries set up by students/teachers themselves (so they got feedback, but there is no official, university wide system).",Excellent,Excellent,Good,Inadequate,Excellent,Good,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Agree,Yes,Yes,,"* The category A and B students should get the same amount of money, except for the travel expense. 500 euros is not enough to live in France/Sweden/Netherlands. 750 is possible. 1000 is *more than enough*. It creates two types of students, with different lifestyles, some of them can barely do anything while the others can have a lot of fun travelling around. For no obvious reason. It should be noted that in many case, it's very difficult to get a student job, as we don't speak the country langage (in Sweden, it's impossible, in France it's very, very hard), plus we get quite involved in courses (language courses in the evening) and projects.  * European rules concerning externat projects should be stated more clearly, from the begining, and in the master webstite.  * Coordinators could coordinate more and not give different answers to the same question.","I knew when begining this master that is was its first year of existence, and that as a result, there would be a lot of problems, questions, and arising difficulties that could not be foreseen. I was aware of that and I accepted it. Actually, it did not go as roughly as I expected, given the fact that four (five) universities are exchanging students, with different rules, organizations, semesters, laws, phylosophies. In conclusion, it as an extraordinary experience. Our coordinators did their best, and even when it fell short on one or two points, they still did a wonderful job most of the time and that should be noted.",Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Adequate,Excellent,Adequate,Good,Inadequate

Understandably, there were still a lot of problems that came up. Recommendations given by the students were sometimes addressed well, but not always. My impression was that the coordinators had a very strong intention to help, but due to a lack of time not all recommendations could be addressed. My main issue is that it sometimes took a long time before we would get more information about regulations regarding for example mobility or credits. This would create unnecessary confusion among the students, or wrong expectations and disappointments. For practical problems, such as visa or housing issues, help was always readily available.","My main recommendation would be to increase communication among the coordinators at the different universities. The coordinators were all individually approachable, but they would not always give you the same answer to questions, creating confusion. Also, if the coordinators would coordinate their response more, it would also be easier to distribute the workload (of for example making a new program guide).

Also, the first semester with courses is now much longer in Groningen than in Uppsala, though the students get the same number of credits. This is not fair and creates frustration among the students.","Overall, it was a really great program and I would definitely do it again.

It is normal that the rules changed on-the-go over the first year, but it is inadmissible that the new students, year after year, joined with the wrong information.

But if someone had asked me simply whether I was happy I could have just said ""no"" and the situation could have been dealt with.

Fairness of scholarship money It just doesn't make sense to throw tons of money at rich kids from Non-European countries.

And this list belonged to an already existing program at KIT. I felt it was too unflexible and there was no opportunity to define a study plan with coordinator (as it was said we would in MERIT progam website), which would have given me a stronger knowledge in my track and on the career path i want to follow. Instead, I had to take mostly compulsory courses and now almost after completing 90 credits i don´t feel i have enough specialization in my track.  At 2nd year (KTH) there was more flexibility and better personalized attention but then interesting courses in my track where in spring where I will already be doing my thesis.  Also I sometimes felt at KIT that instead of being a privilege to belong to an EM program (which i know it is ) it felt like we were just one more exchange student in a foreign university.  On the good side, both administrative coordinators at KIT and KTH were really helpful and attentive with everything that came up. I really thank them.",Good,Inadequate,Adequate,Very inadequate,Good,Adequate,Very inadequate,,,,Adequate,Inadequate,Excellent

I do not know how they are checking does each of the involved Universities is implementing students suggestions, but it seems that some of the Universities are not interested of making any changes. This doesn't seem fair because in the 2nd year we have to be equally distributed per University, and in some of them the things that we hear in the presentations and the actual situation are completely different things, and often can be really bad.",The easiest way would be to make a forum page at each University related only to this particular programme so that we can gain some insight from the student's point of view.

In the 1st year we had 3 month of applied period in Institutes/Companies related to the field of study, but descriptions on which we are choosing where to go are general and at the end some of us got the work that was not expected or described at all. 2. Considering that this 2 year Master programme is supposed to be in English, University of Lleida (my 2nd year host University) should make an effort to fins professors who are able to give proper lectures in English, because there was a lot of moments when nobody understood what is going on in classes, and also going on field trip with Spanish students is meaningless if we don't speak the language. 3. It would be nice if the supervisors responsible for the programme during the 2nd year should pay more attention to students that come there (again related to University of Lleida, I don't know about the rest of Universities). Giving some information related to administration issues (e.g. what are student's responsibilities related to paper signing after thesis defense), more details about the courses, and especially not making a choice of thesis supervisor a fait accompli would make studying there more enjoyable and they would be oh higher quality. Considering that the University is choosing who will come there for the 2nd year to write a master thesis and one can say to specialize in certain field, they made it really hard to do it in a proper way.","I think it would be great if there is any way to make feedback compulsory for both students and professor related to the work that has been done. I was in a situation when I asked one professor (twice) on feedback related to the work that I have done for his course, and he never replied.

The thing was that half of the class was from Spain and there were only two grants for the Spanish people, so  most of them didn't have a grant. But because the program was in Spanish, they also had extrawork correcting non-native  writting, which was also unfair. I suggest that it somehow be controled what people with grant do and what they don't do, since some of them were taking the year almost as paid holidays, often didn't attend class or did almost nothing in the group works.

It would be very good if students had the opportunity to study back in the first year university in the last semester of the programme.","It would be very helpful if the Mundus MAPP programme had partner universities outside the EU as other EM studies seem to have.  Furthermore, it would be very good as well if the mobility programme was much better than it now is - studying in more than two universities instead of one year in one university. For instance, it would be good if we could study in three universities by sharing the first year between two universities and giving the student more choice in the mibolity programme. WHY IS IT THAT OTHER PROGRAMMES HAVE A MUCH BETTER AND A MORE INTENSIVE  MOBILITY PROGRAMME THAN THE MUNDUS MAPP?? By increasing the mobility , students will be exposed to different cultures and different academic environments (every university is different from the other) and suits MUCH BETTER IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAMME",Adequate,Adequate,Very inadequate,Adequate,Adequate,Adequate,Very inadequate,,,,Good,Adequate,No answer

Let us begin at the beginning.  In May of this year, those of us Mundus MAPP students continuing at IBEI in our second year received an e-mail from the administrators welcoming us to the program and promising us further information (stated as ""next week""), specifically on the visa and immigration process and procedures. We received NO information - none at all - on those or any other issues for THE REST OF THE SUMMER (forget ""next week."")  When we were finally provided with information on the immigration process, it came in the form of an e-mail sent on the very last day of July, an e-mail which included the revelation that IBEI would be closed from August 1-25. In other words: here's the info you need, but if you have any questions about it (or anything else for that matter), sorry, we'll be closed for the month by the time you even read this message.  We received no information about when classes started, coursework, course expectations, or anything else that you might expect from a university setting, before the end of August.  At some point over the summer, a few of us noticed that the academic calendar on the IBEI website had been updated to the 2013-2014 academic year. That calendar included dates of September 9-20 for a series of ""pre-session"" courses. Assuming that this was mandatory, and lacking any information otherwise, a number of us planned our arrivals to Barcelona in order to accommodate those dates. It was only after arriving, and visiting IBEI in person, that I was informed that we did not, in fact, have to attend the pre-session.  E-mails on even the most basic administrative questions go unanswered for weeks and weeks on end. I personally began e-mailing IBEI in June of this year asking questions about banking and the administration of my EM scholarship. It took five weeks and three e-mails - the third one CC'd to the administration at my first year university, CEU, which also coordinates the Mundus MAPP program - before I finally received a reply.  Every step of the way, information from IBEI has been random, fragmentary, infrequent, and insufficient. It has been frustrating to the point of lunacy. I cannot but conclude that IBEI is utterly unprepared, and unequipped, to participate as a member of the Mundus MAPP (or any other Erasmus Mundus) consortium.",Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,"Some do, other do not",Somewhat (weak or unclear systems),Yes,Yes,,,,,Strong,Alert the administration at the coordinating university (CEU),Yes,"In the case of CEU, ABSOLUTELY. They have been extraordinarily responsive to student needs and concerns and more than willing to act positively on that feedback. In the case of my second year institution (IBEI), mixed bag. As previously mentioned, IBEI has been so catastrophic in terms of communication with students that it's hard to say anything has been done well. That being said, small day-to-day matters at the institute have, so far, been handled promptly and professionally. Which makes it even more of a shame that the big stuff (""when do classes start,"" ""when do we need to arrive in Barcelona,"" ""how does immigration work"") have been such abject failures.",,Excellent,Excellent,,Very inadequate,,,Agree,Agree,,,Yes,Yes,"IMMIGRATION COHESION. I know this is a complex issue involving the EU, individual nations, competencies, national and international law, and a host of other issues. But, as a non-EU student, nothing else has been as challenging and alarming as the experience of navigating the immigration procedures between the first and second year countries. It is beyond frustrating that I am here, accepted by schools in both countries, confirmed by the Commission, and even awarded an EU scholarship, only to have barrier after barrier thrown in my path by murky immigration processes that seem designed to make me throw my hands up in frustration and just quit. And indeed, in my Mundus MAPP program alone this year, one student was forced to quit the program after completing a year of work because his visa in his second-year country was denied, and at least one other was forced to leave her second-year country and fly back home indefinitely to complete a visa procedure that she was explicitly told she didn't need to bother with in the first place.","Immigration, consortium cohesion, clarity from second-year school (IBEI)","I want to give a special moment of praise here to my first-year school, CEU, which also coordinates the Mundus MAPP program. They have been nothing but exceptional from top to bottom.

We had once a student representative at a consortium meeting to bring up our concerns (this came from the student's initiative though),No,"The students were asked to work on a project of the year (a freely chosen 1-year project on which students should work on their business ideas and develop ideas to crate companies.  We were all really upset when we learnt that no money has been allocated to support these student projects to support prototype development, market research, tests etc. Instead the money is spent on maniford trip in which 100 students fly to another country and listen to presentations etc.  The students in our programme all agreed that this is also important to foster mobility amongst the students and get to know Europe. But we were suggesting to reduce the number of trips and use this money to support student's business ideas.  Furthermore we had other minor issues we addresses through the representative but nothing was changed - no follow up was provided etc.",- there should always be a student representative during consortium meetings who tries to find out aforehand what students see as improvements and brings their opinion forward during these meetings.,Good,Excellent,Good,Inadequate,,,Agree,Neutral,Agree,Neutral,No,No,,"1.) In my programme the overall coordinator has changed during the 2-year programme. In my opinion, I think that the people currently in charge of my programme who organise and lead it are not aware/cannot live/cannot transmit the vision of Erasmus Mundus Master Courses. This leads to unclarities, lack of motivation of the students (e.g. no prober feedback is given etc.), dissatisfaction with the programme. This is in my opinion a big problem for SELECT in future, since I will not be able to fully recommend the programme. I highly appreciate the idea of Erasmus Mundus and SELECT but I do not believe that the current coordinators will be able to carry through this vision and be an inspiring person to both students and the other people involved in the programme.  2.)I think the money allocation should be truely revised. The students are in general highly motivated individuals - who WANT TO WORK HARD and CHANGE something in Europe/in the world. Many want to become entrepreneurs and contribute positively to the society they live in. Therefore, in my opinion the money should be addressed to that mainly: money for funding student projects, community projects etc. should be available and the money spent on travels, seminars etc. should be reduces to an appropriate number - these 'gatherings' should be organised in more digital manners (distant workshops etc.)  3.) A stonger focus should lie on the time after the programme. Europe is aiming at bringing top-most international students to work in Europe, create companies and improve the situation. Now however, after finishing the programme many especially international students are stuggeling to find a job and often have to back to their countries, risking never to be able to come back. Here lies a big problem in my opinion, that the programme has: there is almost no support available to offer these people opportunieties, support them in truely learning languages (which is the key to finding a job in another country).  I would suggest to either increase the potential to get in contact with industrial partners during the programme or offer the students INTENSIVE language course (time should be allocated for that) either during the programme.","I highly appriciate the opportunity to provide my feedback to 'higher' levels in the Erasmus Mundus hierachy, if possible this could also be done after the first year on a more direct path in order to create the pressure for programme coordinators to ensure that they take on the student's feedback and improve the programme at a faster pace.",Good,Adequate,Adequate,Very inadequate,Adequate,Adequate,Adequate,Inadequate,Adequate,Good,Adequate,Inadequate,Adequate

Student life is masters level is of a much higher stature. It would have been great if I had opportunities for Research/Teachning Assistantships during my studies that could complement my career as well as education. Universities and professors must make a way for that and utilize this easily available talent. 2.There is a huge difference in the fees between Category A and B, where individually these universities charge very less amount of fees. If this was purely business, then it wouldn't have been of concern. But business, as I understand, if of last concern to the European Commission facilitating these courses. Additionally, those from Cat B are normally from underdeveloped countries and struggle a lot to find the means.  3. Course content is like all conventional teaching techniques with little of no importance to contemporary industrial world. Hands-on experience facilitated by the program in a live industrial environment would be an added advantage. In fact, classroom theory learning is not the game anymore. Actually I was expecting something like this and was disappointed to a great extend. (I am not taking about laboratory practicals which has nothing to do with live experience)","I am an Indian student in the SpaceMaster programme. I have done my first year and is currently in the second year. Now, I was expecting of working in the industry atleast with an internship after graduation. But to my great disappointment, everywhere I knock, I am (we) getting a response saying that they are preferring European students/nationals. We are paying huge amounts since in category B, but still, it is much harder for us to find a spot in the industry where we can put our knowledge to use. I would suggest the consortium organizing the internship modules/training sessions integrated along with the program content since that wont be a problem in that level of delegation. If that is highly impossible, I would suggest that the consortium arrange a campus-selection drive in the universities participating in the program to select students based on their performance in academics and interviews right from the campus (employers coming to campus for hiring interns).",Good,Adequate,Adequate,Very inadequate,Adequate,Good,Good,,,,Adequate,Inadequate,Very inadequate

More structured courses: there were some overlaps of the courses between the universities.,"More free choice: as an European I was urged to go to Brazil for the last semester of my master. However, I was not willing to do so and it was not obligatory to go there. Nevertheless, the coordinator from Paris university kept insisting on me to go and other coordinators had no power over him to change this. Only due to health problems, I managed to stay in Europe and work with the professor I wanted to work. This is the most unpleasant experience from the whole master and I would like to make sure that the next batches will avoid this kind of situation.   Moreover, the same coordinator was giving very personal grades and the people that had different point of view, were usually awarded with the lower grade.

Additionally, we were quite disappointed in the quality of the professors at Padova University. Notably the Program Director Professor Faggi whose teaching methods are archaic and who is unable to listen to students' opinions. Also Professor Anna Giraldo is a mediocre profesional.

A visit to the USA and exploration of student affairs would be of high value.","Although only 2 months in, apart from the exceptional student composition, I am not inclined to recommend this program to my fellow nationals. The introduction has not been strong or organized enough to create meaningful experiences or education.  I am also discouraged regarding the organization of finances. I would have expected that my scholarship would commence shortly after arrival not 1-2 months into my stay. I have had to extend a significant amount of credit to finance my first few months despite sending in my bank information months in advance. The organization is poor, and I was not warned that I should have upwards of $5000 USD in reserve should the programme be exceptionally slow.",Inadequate,No answer,No answer,No answer,Adequate,Inadequate,Inadequate,,,,Good,Very inadequate,Very inadequate

Some were just did not care.   3.The international students association- that somewhat missing during my stay in the last university (Copenhagen).

At some point, we barely had time to sleep, but on the other hand, the 3-months summer break was far too long. For sure it is a difficult task to change the time frame of each semester since it is dependent on the system of each country, but if it was possible, it would have been better to have slightly less of a summer semester break for the sake of a more relaxed schedule. 2) The teaching standards in Le Creusot should be improved. The first problem was a weekly changing time table which made it hard to plan study times and organise the project work. Furthermore, there was very few input from the lab tutors to help us, I even once got the answer ""if you want to know that, you have to teach yourself."" I do not deny that Master studies should be self-organised in some extent, but for this big amount of topics to learn it is helpful to get a bit of advice from the tutors. 3) It would have been nice to get more opportunities to learn languages. Maybe it could be considered to let the students choose between the ""Local Culture"" course and a language course.","In general, the VIBOT programme is really rich and gives a good overview about the whole field.

You can work hard and be active and in the end only the mark of your thesis is the fact that shows what you have been doing for two years. This enabled some students to do nothing. However, in the end it turned that your thesis is evaluated by examiners who do not know anything about your progress throughout the studies. This just supports the idea that you can do nothing in regards to modules, but if you finish your thesis in the ""right"" (I mean right in accordance to your examiners' opinion) you can finish the programme with the best mark as the ones who worked hard all the time. This is so unfair system of grading.","I think that the grading system throughout the course was completely unfair. As we had just comments, so it enabled some people to work almost nothing. Conversely, in the end of the studies the people who did nothing are able to get A or B, as the ones who worked hard all the time.

Scholarship- as expressed previously we all have the same things to pay for when we are living in the countries we are studying in. As an EU student it was not possible for me to apply for any additional grant from my home country.  As you are probably aware the cost of living in Norway and Dublin is quite high when you have to take accommodation, transport and food into consideration. Other students who had the bigger scholarship were able to go travelling during our holidays over the two years whilst some students on the smaller grant struggled with day-day basic living.  This was unfair. To further the problem with the scholarship was delayed payments and also payments with an incorrect amount (less than what I should have got). In my case this took a few payments before it was sorted properly and then resulted in uneven payments for a few months. The scholarship was something which should have occurred every month at the same time with no problems since we were getting the same amount each month.  3. Overall, there were organisational issues within the course which again should be known and sorted beforehand. I do take into consideration the course is only new so there would things that are not 100% sorted.  With regard to the thesis, the thesis course handbook needs to be more detailed and concise especially in terms of the marking criteria which still remains unclear to me. I consulted APA, the thesis handbook and the University handbook where I completed my thesis. In some cases, there were conflicting requirements.
